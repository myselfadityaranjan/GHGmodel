# GHG Emissions Prediction and Land Use Optimization with PyTorch

This project aims to predict future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and optimize land use to enhance carbon sinks using machine learning models built with PyTorch. The project combines historical GHG data and satellite imagery to create models that forecast emissions and suggest optimal land use changes to mitigate climate change.

## Project Overview
This project involves two key tasks:
1. **Predicting GHG Emissions**: Using time series models (e.g., LSTMs) to predict future GHG emissions based on historical data.
2. **Optimizing Land Use**: Using satellite imagery to classify land cover and suggest optimal land use changes to increase carbon sequestration.

## Installation
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
